## Auxiliary Data

### Reference States, Default for Fluid

**Enthalpy**
H = <units us = "19771.296 Btu/lb-mole at 80.3 째F and 0.15 psia" metric="2551.014 kJ/kg at 26.9 째C and 0.010 bar"></units>

**Entropy**
S = <units us = "39.198 Btu/lb-mole*R at 80.3 째F and 0.15 psia" metric = "9.104 J/g*K at 26.9 째C and 0.010 bar"></units>

### Equation of State
The uncertainty in density of the equation of state is 0.0001% at 1 atm in the liquid phase, 
and 0.001% at other liquid states at pressures up to <units us = "1450 psi and temperatures to 761.4 R. 
In the vapor phase, the uncertainty is 0.05% or less. The uncertainties rise at higher temperatures and/or pressures, but 
are generally less than 0.1% in density except at extreme conditions."
metric = "10 MPa  and temperatures to 423 K. In the vapor phase, the uncertainty is 0.05% or less. The uncertainties rise at higher temperatures and/or pressures, but are generally less than 0.1% in density except at extreme conditions."/>

The uncertainty in pressure in the critical region is 0.1%. 

The uncertainty of the speed of sound is 0.15% in the vapor and 0.1% or less in the liquid, and increases near the critical region and at high temperatures and pressures. 

The uncertainty in isobaric heat capacity is 0.2% in the vapor and 0.1% in the liquid, with increasing values in the critical region and at high pressures. 

The uncertainties of saturation conditions are 0.025% in vapor pressure, 0.0025% in saturated liquid density, and 0.1% in saturated vapor density. The uncertainties in the saturated densities increase substantially as the critical region is approached.
