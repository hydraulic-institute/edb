## Properties of Other Fluids 

### Degrees A.P.I. vs. Specific Gravity for Oil          

The relation of Degrees A.P.I. to Specific Gravity (g) is expressed by the following formula:

=+=
<span class= equation-label >(2.5)</span>
$$ {Degrees\,A.P.I. = {141.5 \over g} - 131.5} $$
=+=

=+=
$$ {g = {141.5 \over {131.5 + Degrees\,A.P.I.}}} $$
=+=

The following tables are based on the weight of 1 gallon (U.S.) of oil with a volume of 231 cubic inches at 60°F in air at 760 mm pressure 
and 50% humidity. Assumed weight of 1 gallon of water at 60°F in air is 8.32828 pounds.

To determine the resulting specific gravity by mixing oils of different specific gravities:

=+=
<span class= equation-label >(2.6)</span>
$$ {D = {{md_{1} + nd_{2}} \over {m+n}}} $$
=+=

where:

- D = density or specific gravity of mixture
- m = proportion of oil of d<sub>1</sub> density
- n = proportion of oil of d<sub>2</sub> density
- d<sub>1</sub> = specific gravity of m oil
- d<sub>2</sub> = specific gravity of n oil
