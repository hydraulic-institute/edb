# Educational Demonstration

## Pumps in Series
This demo explores how impeller diameter and speed affect three different pumps
(A, B, and C).  This demo also explores different scenarios of the three pumps operating in
series.

***Change the Static Head***

Use the toggle buttons by the reservoirs to increase or decrease elevation levels, thereby
changing the static head.

***Explore How Speed Affects a Pump Curve***

Use the toggle buttons in the blue area to increase or decrease speed for a particular pump.

***Explore How Impeller Diameter Affects a Pump Curve***

Use the toggle buttons in the orange area to increase or decrease diameter for a particular pump.

**Turn Different Curves On/Off**

1)	Click the chart

2)	Select the "Chart Filters" Icon
