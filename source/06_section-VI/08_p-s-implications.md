# Parallel and Series System Implications

The overall effect on the system behavior when adding pumps in parallel depends on the type of system, i.e. the shape of the system curve. For friction dominated system (steep system curve) 
the bring additional parallel pumps online may not change the operating point (more flow or head) much. Conversely, adding more parallel pumps to a system that is dominated 
by static head (flatter system curve) will have a greater effect on the operating point.

Since the head is additive for series pumps, the effect would also be different. Using more pumps on a friction dominated system will have a significant increase in head with a lesser increase in
flow. A static dominated system will be the opposite, there will be a significant increase in flow with a lesser increase in head.
