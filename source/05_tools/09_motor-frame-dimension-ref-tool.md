*The tolerances on the D dimension for rigid base motors shall be +0.00 inch, −0.06 inch. No tolerance has been established for the D dimension of resilient mounted motors.

†Frames 42 to 56H, inclusive—The tolerance for the 2F dimension shall be ±0.03 inch and for the H dimension (width of slot) shall be +0.02 inch, −0.00 inch.

Frames 143T to 500, inclusive—The tolerance for the 2E and 2F dimensions shall be ±0.03 inch and for the H dimension shall be +0.05 inch, −0.00 inch.

The values of the H dimension represent standard bolt sizes plus dimensional clearances.

H dimension: Frames 143T to 365T, inclusive—The clearance of the std. bolt to hole size is 0.03 inch. The tolerance is +0.05, −0.00 inch. Frames 404T to 449T, inclusive—The clearance of the std. bolt to hole size is 0.06 inch. The tolerance is +0.020 inch, −0.00 inch.

††For dimensions of clearance holes, see 4.8.

**For the 2F dimension and corresponding third (and when required, the fourth) digit in the frame series, see 4.2.1 and Table 4-2.

***BA tolerance: ±0.09 inch.

#### **Notes:**
1. For the meaning of the letter dimensions, see 4.1 and Figures 4-1 and 4-2.
2. For tolerances on shaft extension diameters and keyseats, see 4.9.
3. Frames 42 to 56H, inclusive—if the shaft extension length of the motor is not suitable for the application, it is recommended that deviations from this length be in 0.25 inch increments.
4. For cast-iron products, bottom of feet coplanar: 0.015 inch.
5. For cast-iron products, foot top parallel to foot bottom: 1.5 degree.
6. For cast-iron products, shaft parallel to foot plan: 0.015 inch

**For frames 182TC, 184TC, and 213TC through 500TC, the centerline of the bolt holes shall be within 0.025 inch of true location. True location is defined as angular and diametrical location with reference to the centerline of the AK dimension.

†The tolerance on this BB dimension shall be +0.00 inch, −0.06 inch.

††These BD dimensions are nominal dimensions.

†††For dimensions of clearance holes, see 4.8.

#### **Notes:**
1. For the meaning of the letter dimensions, see 4.1 and Figure 4-3.
2. For tolerances on shaft extension diameters and keyseats, see 4.9.
3. For tolerances on AK dimensions, face runout, and permissible eccentricity of mounting rabbet, see 4.12.
4. If the shaft extension length of the motor is not suitable for the application, it is recommended that deviations from this length be in 0.25 inch increments.
