This is not defined in other HI publications. The EDL appears to be the first time we provide this definition. Our definition is consistent with other texts/internet and my understanding.

Pete modified the definition per EDL and understanding 

From internet: 

(Wikipedia) The friction loss in uniform, straight sections of pipe, known as ""major loss"", is caused by the effects of viscosity, the movement of fluid molecules against each other or against the (possibly rough) wall of the pipe. Here, it is greatly affected by whether the flow is laminar (Re < 2000) or turbulent (Re > 4000):[1]

(Nuclear-power.com) Head loss of the hydraulic system is divided into two main categories:
Major Head Loss - due to friction in straight pipes
Minor Head Loss - due to components as valves, bends..."

EDL A&D Group",Pump Curves,"Confirm or modify definition (no official source), Pete has provided suggested definition that is within the HI Standards/Guideline Text. Jeff is checking on this with 14.3 and 9.6.3

9.6.3 Committee draft: 9.6.3.4.3.10 Pump curves with instabilities
A pump curve is considered stable if it is continuously rising from end of curve (runout) to shutoff. Curves which are not continuously rising will require special consideration for stable operation.

14.3-202X - 14.3.3.3.2 A pump performance curve displays the head generated by a specific pump model at rates of flow from zero (shut- off) to maximum flow (runout) at a given operating speed   

EDL: Shut-off Head and Pump Runout:
These points are important during manufacturer testing to fully define the shape of the pump curve. They are the furthest points to the left and right on the curve. Shut-off is the condition of zero flow rate where no liquid is flowing through the pump, but the pump is primed and running. Operating at this point for more than a few seconds can cause serious mechanical issues. Pump Runout is the point at which flow is at a maximum. Operating at this flow can cause cavitation, vibration and, in some pumps, overloading of the driver. These points are to be avoided when operating pumps.

2023-04-27: EDL A&D Group agreed to the definition ""The highest flowrate shown on the published pump curve."" and to change the main term defined from ""Maximum Flow (Pump Runout)"" to ""Pump Runout (Maximum Flow)"""

,Semi-Open Impeller,"A semi-open impeller has a shroud only on one side, leaving the vanes exposed on the other side. Semiopen impellers typically require hydraulic balancing as a result of the pressure acting on the surface area of the back shroud.

Slurries also occur when solids are present as an incidental part of the process. Properties of the solids and the liquid, as well as the amount of solids, are variable. The solids particle size may vary from a few micrometers, often referred to as microns, up to hundreds of millimeters, and depending upon the size different solids will tend to settle below different threshold transport velocities. Therefore, the properties of slurry are highly variable. Slurry may behave like a Newtonian or non-Newtonian fluid. It may be abrasive and/or corrosive depending on the composition. Slurry pumps are typically used to transport slurries with specific gravities up to 5.3 and solids concentration between 2% and 50% by volume.
