# Diameter and Speed Constants
Pump curve characteristics can be predicted by:

- Changing impeller diameter (geometrically similar impeller)
- Changing pump impeller speed (rpm) 

The equations to adjust curve characteristics by impeller diameter with speed remaining constant:

- **Flow**:
=+=
$$ { {q_1 \over q_2} = {d_1 \over d_2} } $$
=+=

=+=
$$ q = flow\ capacity\ (m^3,\ /s,\ gpm\ cfm\ etc.) $$
=+=

=+=
$$ d = Wheel\ diameter\ (in,\ ft,\ m) $$
=+=

- **Pressure or Head**:
=+=
$$ { {dp_1 \over dp_2} = { ({d_1 \over d_2)})^2 } } $$
=+=

=+=
$$ dp = pressure\ or\ head\ (psi,\ ft,\ m,\ etc.) $$
=+=

- **Power**:
=+=
$$ { {P_1 \over P_2} = { ({d_1 \over d_2)})^3 } } $$
=+=

=+=
$$ P = Power\ (hp,\ w,\ etc.) $$
=+=
