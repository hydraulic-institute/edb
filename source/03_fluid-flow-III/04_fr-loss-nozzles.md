## Losses in Nozzles

The actual discharge from nozzles will vary from
90% to 95% of the theoretical discharge.
For hydraulic sluicing the following pressures at
base of nozzles are recommended:


**Light fine material and loose sandy soil:** <units us = "50 to 75 psig" metric = "345 to 517 kPa"/>

**Stiff loam overburden:** <units us = "100 to 125 psig" metric = "690 to 862 kPa"/>

**Hard clay:** <units us = "150 to 200 psig" metric = "1034 to 1379 kPa"/>


The following amounts of water are recommended to move 1 cubic foot:

**Heavy sand:** <units us = "20 cubic feet of water" metric = "0.57 cubic meters of water"/>

**Average quarry overburden:** <units us = "8 to 10 cubic feet of water" metric = "0.23 to 0.28 cubic meters of water"/>

$$  Q = 19.636*C*{d_1}^2*\sqrt {h} $$

Where:

- Q  = Flowrate in <units us = "gallons per minute" metric = "m^3^/s"/>
- d<sub>1</sub> = Nozzle Diameter in <units us = "inches" metric = "inches"/>
- h = Head in <units us = "feet" metric = "meters"/> 
- C = Discharge Coefficient = 1

For sprinkling golf courses it is reasonably safe to figure 10 gallons per minute
for each Green with 35 PSIA at hose valve outlet and 25 gallons per minute for each 
Fairway with 35 PSIA at hose valve outlet. The standard conditions are 100 feet of 
¾ inch hose for greens sprinklers and 100 feet of 1 inch hose for fairway sprinklers.
Use gate valves with a hose nipple at all outlets instead of the customary hose faucets 
on account of the friction loss in the hose faucets.

title: Fundamentals of Variable Speed Pumping: 1-Part On-Demand Webinar
description: This webinar is an introduction to variable speed pumping and how to use it for more efficient and better controlled pumping. It explains how flow and pressure are controlled with variable speed pumping and when to use each. Also covered are the devices used to achieve variable speed pumping, including variable frequency drives. The attendee will also learn the benefits provided by variable speed pumping, in relation to cost, operation, and energy savings.
