## Losses in Nozzles

The actual discharge from nozzles will vary from 90% to 95% of the theoretical discharge.

$$  Q = 19.636·C·{d_1}^2·\sqrt {h} $$

Where:

- Q  = Flowrate in gallons per minute <!--units us = "gallons per minute" metric = "m^3^/s"/-->
- d<sub>1</sub> = Nozzle Diameter in inches <!--units us = "inches" metric = "inches"/-->
- h = Head in feet<!--units us = "feet" metric = "meters"/--> 
- C = Discharge Coefficient = 1

For hydraulic sluicing the following pressures at base of nozzles are recommended:

**Light fine material and loose sandy soil:** 50 to 75 psig<!--units us = "50 to 75 psig" metric = "345 to 517 kPa"/-->

**Stiff loam overburden:** 100 to 125 psig<!--units us = "100 to 125 psig" metric = "690 to 862 kPa"/-->

**Hard clay:** 150 to 200 psig<!--units us = "150 to 200 psig" metric = "1034 to 1379 kPa"/-->

The following amounts of water are recommended to move 1 cubic foot:<!--units us = "1 cubic foot:" metric = "0.03 cubic meters:"/-->

**Heavy sand:** 20 cubic feet of water<!--units us = "20 cubic feet of water" metric = "0.57 cubic meters of water"/-->

**Average quarry overburden:** 8 to 10 cubic feet of water<!--units us = "8 to 10 cubic feet of water" metric = "0.23 to 0.28 cubic meters of water"/-->

**For sprinkling golf courses** it is reasonably safe to figure 10 gallons per minute for each Green with 35 PSIA at hose valve outlet and 25 gallons per minute for each Fairway with 35 PSIA at hose valve outlet. The standard conditions are 100 feet of ¾ inch hose for greens sprinklers and 100 feet of 1 inch hose for fairway sprinklers. Use gate valves with a hose nipple at all outlets instead of the customary hose faucets on account of the friction loss in the hose faucets.

title: Fundamentals of Variable Speed Pumping: 1-Part On-Demand Webinar
description: This webinar is an introduction to variable speed pumping and how to use it for more efficient and better controlled pumping. It explains how flow and pressure are controlled with variable speed pumping and when to use each. Also covered are the devices used to achieve variable speed pumping, including variable frequency drives. The attendee will also learn the benefits provided by variable speed pumping, in relation to cost, operation, and energy savings.
