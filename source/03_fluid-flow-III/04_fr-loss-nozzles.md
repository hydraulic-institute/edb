## Losses in Nozzles

The actual discharge from nozzles will vary from
90% to 95% of the theoretical discharge.
For hydraulic sluicing the following pressures at
base of nozzles are recommended:


**Light fine material and loose sandy soil:** <units us = "50 to 75 psig" metric = "345 to 517 kPa"/>

**Stiff loam overburden:** <units us = "100 to 125 psig" metric = "690 to 862 kPa"/>

**Hard clay:** <units us = "150 to 200 psig" metric = "1034 to 1379 kPa"/>


The following amounts of water are recommended to move 1 cubic foot:

**Heavy sand:** <units us = "20 cubic feet of water" metric = "0.57 cubic meters of water"/>

**Average quarry overburden:** <units us = "8 to 10 cubic feet of water" metric = "0.23 to 0.28 cubic meters of water"/>

title: Hydraulic Modeling and Simulation of Pumping Systems - 2 Part Webinar
description: This course discusses the differences between component optimization and system optimization and demonstrates how analysis software can be used to improve pump system operation. It provides examples and case studies demonstrating how hydraulic modeling software, such as the PÂ·SMART tool, is used to diagnose and correct problems with pump system operation in real-world situations.
