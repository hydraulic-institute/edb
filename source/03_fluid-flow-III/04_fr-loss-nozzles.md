## Losses in Nozzles

The actual discharge from nozzles will vary from
90% to 95% of the theoretical discharge.
For hydraulic sluicing the following pressures at
base of nozzles are recommended:


**Light fine material and loose sandy soil:** <units us = "50 to 75 psig" metric = "345 to 517 kPa"/>

**Stiff loam overburden:** <units us = "100 to 125 psig" metric = "690 to 862 kPa"/>

**Hard clay:** <units us = "150 to 200 psig" metric = "1034 to 1379 kPa"/>


The following amounts of water are recommended to move 1 cubic foot:

**Heavy sand:** <units us = "20 cubic feet of water" metric = "0.57 cubic meters of water"/>

**Average quarry overburden:** <units us = "8 to 10 cubic feet of water" metric = "0.23 to 0.28 cubic meters of water"/>
