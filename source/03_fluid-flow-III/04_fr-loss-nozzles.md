# Frictional Losses of Nozzles

The actual discharge from nozzles will vary from
90% to 95% of the theoretical discharge.
For hydraulic sluicing the following pressures at
base of nozzles are recommended:


**Light fine material and loose sandy soil:** <units us = "50 to 75 psig" metric = "345 to 517 kPa"/>

**Stiff loam overburden:** <units us = "100 to 125 psig" metric = "690 to 862 kPa"/>

**Hard clay:** <units us = "150 to 200 psig" metric = "1034 to 1379 kPa"/>


The following amounts of water are recommended to move 1 cubic foot:

**Heavy sand:** <units us = "20 cubic feet of water" metric = "0.57 cubic meters of water"/>

**Average quarry overburden:** <units us = "8 to 10 cubic feet of water" metric = "0.23 to 0.28 cubic meters of water"/>

<units us = "For sprinkling golf courses it is reasonably safe to
figure 10 gallons per minute for each green with 35
PSIA at hose valve outlet and 25 gallons per minute
for each fairway with 35 PSIA at hose valve outlet.
The standard conditions are 100 feet of 3/4 inch
hose for greens sprinklers and 100 feet of 1 inch
hose for fairways sprinklers. Use gate valves with
a hose nipple at all outlets instead of the customary
hose faucets on account of the frictional losses in the
hose faucets." metric = "For sprinkling golf courses it is reasonably safe to
figure 2.27 cubic meters per hour for each green with 241
kPa at hose valve outlet and 5.68 cubic meters per hour
for each fairway with 241 kPa at hose valve outlet.
The standard conditions are 30.5 meters of 19.05 mm
hose for Greens sprinklers and 30.5 meters of 25.4 mm
hose for fairways sprinklers. Use gate valves with
a hose nipple at all outlets instead of the customary
hose faucets on account of the frictional losses in the
hose faucets."/>
