## Losses With Other Fluids

### Calculation of Frictional Losses for Other Fluids



The pipe friction for the incompressible flow of viscous fluids, including water, in several sizes of pipe and pipe materials are outlined in the 
<a href="/tools/frictional-losses.html" target="_blank">Friction Loss Calculator</a>. 
Pipe friction is based on the  pipe characteristics and  kinematic viscosity, or dynamic viscosity with Specific Gravity.
Further information on viscosity and commonly accepted viscosity values for liquids will be found in the <a href="/fluid-properties-II/viscosity.html" target="_blank">viscosity section</a>. section. 
No allowance has been made for abnormal conditions of interior surface or installation nor for the deterioration with age. (See <a href="/fluid-flow-III/general.html" target="_blank">Fluid Flow – General</a>.)
