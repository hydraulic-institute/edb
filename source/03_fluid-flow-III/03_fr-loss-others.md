# Calculation of Friction Loss for Other Fluids

The pipe friction charts, Figs. IIIC-2 thru IIIC-13
incl., show friction-loss moduli for the incompressible
flow of viscous fluids, including water, in several
sizes of new clean steel or wrought iron pipes
having Schedule 40 wall thickness. Each chart covers
the losses for a single size of pipe based on the
kinematic viscosity in centistokes (cs). As viscosity
is frequently given in Seconds Saybolt Universal,
(SSu), corresponding rounded values at 100 °F are
shown except in the case of low viscositites where
no accurate SSU equivalents exist. Further information
on viscosity and commonly accepted viscosity
values for liquids will be found in <a href="/fluid-properties-II/viscosity.html" target="_blank">section IIC</a>.
No allowance has been made for abnormal
conditions of interior surface or installation nor for
the deterioration with age. (See <a href="/fluid-flow-III/general.html" target="_blank">section IIIA</a>.)

Friction loss moduli for laminar flow are shown by
the 45-degree lines in the upper left hand portion
of each chart. Moduli for turbulent flow are shown
by the steeper curves in the lower right hand portion.
Both of these regions represent stable states
of flow. A diagonal line separates the regions of
laminar and turbulent flow and represents the critical
zone, a region in which it is difficult to predict
the state of flow and hence, the friction loss. The
critical zone usually represents a region of unstable
flow. The critical zone line gives approximate
moduli on the high side for this region of
unstable flow.

The bottom scale of each chart represents flow in
gallons per minute, gpm. An auxiliary top scale
shows the average velocity in the pipe in feet per
second. Read vertically from the gpm scale to find
the corresponding velocity in feet per second. The
vertical scales, labeled "Friction Loss Modulus for
100 Feet of Pipe", represent values of the ratio

=+=
<span class= equation-label >(10)</span>
$$ M = {Δp \over s} $$
=+=

where:

- M = Friction loss modulus for 100 <units us = "feet of pipe" metric = "meters of pipe"/>
- Δp = Pressure loss in <units us = "pounds per square inch per 100 feet of pipe" metric = "kPa per 100 meters of pipe"/>
- s = Specific gravity of fluid at <units us = "60 °F" metric = "15.56°C"/>

The loss due to pipe friction may be obtained as follows:

=+=
<span class= equation-label >(11)</span>
$$ Δp = M * s $$
=+=

and

=+=
<span class= equation-label >(12)</span>
$$ h_{f} = 2.31M $$
=+=

where:

- h<sub>f</sub> = Friction head loss in feet of fluid per 100 <units us = "feet of pipe" metric = "meters of pipe"/>

The other quantities are listed under Equation (10).

To use the charts, proceed as follows:

a) Select the chart for the size of pipe in question.

b) Follow the vertical line representing the flow rate to its intersection with the desired viscosity
curve, and read the modulus at the left.

c) If the vertical line representing the flow rate
does not intersect the viscosity line in either turbulent
or laminar flow, use the intersection with the
critical zone line.

d) Compute the friction loss in pressure drop or
head, as desired, from Equations (11) or (12)
above. These equations are repeated on each chart.
