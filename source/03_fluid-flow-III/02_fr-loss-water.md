1. The value of D given in the charts is nominal IPS (Iron Pipe Size).
2. <units us = "For velocities below 15 feet per second, check valves and foot valves will be only partially open and will exhibit higher values of K than that shown in the charts." metric = "For velocities below 4.6 meters per second, check valves and foot valves will be only partially open and will exhibit higher values of K than that shown in the charts."/>
