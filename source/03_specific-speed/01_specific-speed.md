# Specific Speed

- **Specific Speed** - An index of pump performance (developed total head) at the pump’s  best  efficiency point (BEP) rate of flow, with the maximum diameter impeller, and at a given rotative speed. Specific  speed is expressed by the following equation:

=+=
$$ n_s = { {n(Q)^{0.5} } \over {(H)^{0.75} } } $$
=+=

$$ n_s = Specific\ Speed $$

$$ n = Rotational\ speed,\ in\ revolutions\ per\ minute $$

$$ Q = Total\ pump\ flow\ rate,\ in\ cubic\ meters\ per\ second\ (US\ gallons\ per\ minute) $$
=+=

=+=
$$ H = Head\ per\ stage,\ in\ meters\ (feet) $$
=+=

The user is cautioned to check carefully the basis of calculation of specific speed and suction specific speed before making comparisons because there are subtle but significant differences in methods used throughout industry and in related textbooks and literature.

When calculating specific speed using units of cubic meters per second for flow rate and meters for head per stage, 51.6 is the conversion factor for specific speed in US gallons per minute and feet (i.e., metric × 51.6 = US customary units.)

The usual symbol for specific speed in US customary units is:
=+=
$$ N_s $$
=+=

## US Customary units
When calculating the value for specific speed and suction specific speed, the unit of measurement used for rate of flow is defined in US gallons per minute (gpm).

## Metric units
When calculating the value for specific speed and suction specific speed, the unit of measurement used within this standard for rate of flow is cubic meters per second (m3/s).

An alternative method of calculating this value is to use (m3/h) as the unit of measurement for rate of flow, which then results in a value that is i.e., 60 times greater.
