# Suction Specific Speed

- **Suction Specific Speed** - An index of pump suction operating characteristics. It is determined at the BEP rate of flow with the maximum diameter impeller. (Suction specific speed is an indicator of the net positive suction head required [NPSH3] for given values of capacity and also provides an assessment of a pump's susceptibility to internal recirculation.) Suction specific speed is expressed by the following equation:

=+=
$$ S = { {n(Q)^{0.5} } \over {(NPSH3)^{0.75} } } $$
=+=

- **S** - Suction Specific Speed
- **n** - Rotational speed, in revolutions per minute
- **Q** - Total flow rate for single suction impellers
- **NPSH3** - Net positive suctions head required in meteres (feet) that will cause the total head (or first stage head of multistage pumps) to be reduced by 3%

Suction specific speed derived using cubic meters per second and meters, multiplied by a factor of 51.6, is equal to suction specific speed derived using US gallons per minute and feet. The US customary symbol N<sub>SS</sub> is sometimes used to designate suction specific speed.

The user is cautioned to check carefully the basis of calculation of specific speed and suction specific speed before making any comparisons because there are subtle but significant differences in methods used throughout industry and in related textbooks and literature.
