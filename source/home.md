# Engineering Data Book
The Hydraulic Institute came into being on April 18-19, 1917, when sixteen manufacturers of industrial pumps met and formed The Hydraulic Society. In 1933 the Society was reorganized and the name changed to the Hydraulic Institute. In 1917, when the Society was formed, the pump industry was faced with an urgent need to solve a number of engineering problems brought about by the production needs of World War I. Today, while the activity has grown manifold, engineering is still the basic interest. The most important manifestations of this interest appear in the development of standards, in engineering conferences, in sponsorship of cooperative research projects, and in cooperation with other engineering organizations. 

# Purpose and Aims
The purpose and aims of the Institute are best expressed in the following quotation taken from Article II of the By-Laws of the Institute:

"The Objects of the Institute are: To promote and further the interests of manufacturers of pumps, as well as the interests of the public in such matters as are involved in manufacturing, engineering, safety, transportation, and other problems of the industry, and to this end, among other things: 

(a) To develop and publish standards for pumps.

(b) To collect and disseminate information of value to its members and to the public.

(c) To appear for its members before governmental departments and agencies and other bodies in regard to matters affecting the industry.

(d) To promote a spirit of cooperation among its members for the improved production, proper use, and increased distribution of pumps.

(e) To increase the amount and to improve the quality of pump service to the public.

(f) To support educational and research activities.

(g) To promote the business interests of its members but not to engage in business of the kind ordinarily carried on for profit or to perform particular services for its members or individual persons as distinguished from activities to improve the business conditions and lawful interests of all of its members."
