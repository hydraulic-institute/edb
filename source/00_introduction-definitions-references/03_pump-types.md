### Pump Types

The Hydraulic Institute standardizes rotodynamic and positive displacement pump types, definitions and nomenclature. The description for each pump type and acronym, and the related industry standard are included. 

Rotodynamic pumps are a class which impart energy to the pumped fluid by means of a rotating impeller, propeller or rotor. They include centrifugal pumps, and mixed and axial flow pumps. Positive displacement pumps are a class which trap and move a volume of fluid with each shaft rotation. Positive displacement pumps are divided into reciprocating types, which use pistons, plungers and diaphragms, and rotary types, which utilize meshing components, such as, screws, gears, lobes and vanes.
