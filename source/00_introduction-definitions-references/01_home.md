# Hydraulic Institute Engineering Data Library
The HI Engineering Data Library is a comprehensive guide for pump users, manufacturers, and engineers in need of references for pump and system principles, 
calculations and unit conversions. It covers topics like net positive suction head, pump and system curves, and frictional losses, utilizing standards developed by
HI and other reputable sources. The data library is reviewed by a committee and updated periodically with new information.
