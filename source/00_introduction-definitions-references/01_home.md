The Hydraulic Institute Data Tool is a comprehensive technical resource for pump systems. It provides definitions, resources, references, pump and system fundamental knowledge, interactive pump system demonstrators, fluid property data, fluid flow equations, and easy to use pump system calculators. Covering topics like net positive suction head (NPSH), pump and system curves, frictional losses in piping systems, and much more, it is a vital tool for everyone that works in the pump and system industry.  

Consistent with all publications of the Institute, the Data Tool is developed by a committee of subject matter experts, and is peer reviewed and updated periodically. All external information, calculators and tools provided utilize standards developed by the Hydraulic Institute and other reputable sources.  

The Data Tool includes a navigation bar that can be expanded to find the specific topic of interest, or you can search for specific words or topics. Use the search bar on the upper left corner of each page to find what you are looking for. 

A powerful resource within the Data Tool are the calculator tools. Reference the Tools section for unit conversions, a pipe friction loss calculator, tank volume calculators, atmospheric pressure calculators, and motor dimensions.   

The Data Tool incorporates both *U.S.* and *Metric* units. To toggle between units, use the button on the upper right corner of each page. **(Note: that if the page does not contain a unit button, the page deals with one set of units.)**

<units us = "This page is currently set to U.S. customary units." metric = "This page is currently set to Metric units."/>
