# Pump Curve Tutorial

A pump performance curve is a graphical representation of the head generated by a specific pump model at rates of flow from zero to maximum at a given operating speed.

## Head and Flow Curve

The head and flow curve is the most commonly used curve to describe pump performance. It shows the amount of pressure developed 
across a range of flow rates. On the y-axis is the pressure developed, typically converted to head in units of feet (ft). On the
x-axis is the flow rate, typically in units of gallons per minute (GPM). Head can be determined from the following equation, where 
h is head in ft, P is pressure in psi and SG is specific gravity (unitless):

=+=
$$ h =  {{2.31 * P} \over SG} $$
=+=

Specific gravity can be found by using the following equation, where ρ is density:

=+=
$$ SG = {ρ_{pumped fluid} \over ρ_{water}}  $$
=+=

Using head, the performance of the pump can be shown independent of the density of the fluid pumped.

## Efficiency Curve

Pump efficiency is shown as a percentage on most pump curves. Pump efficiency is defined by the equation below:

=+=
$$ η = {HP_{fluid} \over HP_{shaft}}  $$
=+=

The efficiency curve shows how efficient a pump is at various flow rates. The flow rate where efficiency is at a maximum
is called the pump’s best efficiency point (BEP). BEP is an important operating point that is further described later in this section.

## Horsepower Curve

The horsepower curve shows the amount of brake, or shaft, horsepower required for different flow rates. BHP can be determined by the following equation where Q is flow in GPM:

=+=
$$ BHP = {{Q * h * SG} \over {3960 * η}} $$
=+=

BHP can also be determined if the amount of power absorbed by the fluid and efficiency are known by rearranging the equation shown for the efficiency curve:

=+=
$$ BHP = {HP_{fluid} \over η}  $$
=+=
